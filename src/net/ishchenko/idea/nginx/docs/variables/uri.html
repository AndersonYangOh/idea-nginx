<p>This variable is equal to current URI in the request (without arguments, those are in $args.) It can differ from $request_uri which is what is sent by the browser. Examples of how it can be modified are internal redirects, or with the use of <a href="/HttpIndexModule#index" title="HttpIndexModule">index</a>. Does not include host name. Example: &quot;/foo/bar.html&quot; </p>
