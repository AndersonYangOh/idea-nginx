</div><p>A worker process is a single-threaded process. </p><p>If Nginx is doing CPU-intensive work such as SSL or gzipping and you have 2 or more CPUs/cores, then you may set worker_processes to be equal to the number of CPUs or cores. </p><p>If you are serving a lot of static files and the total size of the files is bigger than the available memory, then you may increase worker_processes to fully utilize disk bandwidth. </p><p>Your OS may schedule all workers on single CPU/core this can be avoided using <a href="/CoreModule#worker_cpu_affinity" title="CoreModule">worker_cpu_affinity</a>. </p><p>Nginx has the ability to use more than one worker process for several reasons: </p><ol>
 <li> to use SMP </li>
 <li> to decrease latency when workers blockend on disk I/O </li>
 <li> to limit number of connections per process when select()/poll() is used </li>
</ol><p>The <code>worker_processes</code> and <code>worker_connections</code> from the event sections allows you to calculate <code>maxclients</code> value: </p><p>max_clients = worker_processes * worker_connections </p><br><i>Module: CoreModule</i>
