</p><p>By default, Nginx does not pass headers "Status" and "X-Accel-..." from the FastCGI process back to the client. 
This directive can be used to hide other headers as well.
</p><p>If the headers "Status" and "X-Accel-..." must be provided, then it is necessary to use directive fastcgi_pass_header to force them to be returned to the client.
