<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="proxy_cache"> proxy_cache </span></h2><p><b>syntax:</b> <i>proxy_cache zone_name;</i> </p><p><b>default:</b> <i>None</i> </p><p><b>context:</b> <i>http, server, location</i> </p><p>This directive sets name of zone for caching. The same zone can be used in multiple places. </p><p>The cache honors backend's &quot;Expires&quot;, &quot;Cache-Control: no-cache&quot;, and &quot;Cache-Control: max-age=XXX&quot; headers since version 0.7.48. Since version 7.66, &quot;private&quot; and &quot;no-store&quot; are also honored. nginx does not handle &quot;Vary&quot; headers when caching. In order to ensure private items are not served to all users unintentionally by the cache, the back-end can set &quot;no-cache&quot; or &quot;max-age=0&quot;, or the <a href="#proxy_cache_key">proxy_cache_key</a> must include user-specific data such as $cookie_xxx. However, using cookie values as part of <b>proxy_cache_key</b> can defeat the benefits of caching for public items, so separate locations with different <b>proxy_cache_key</b> values might be necessary to separate private and public items. </p><p>The cache depends on proxy buffers, and will not work if proxy_buffers is set to off. </p><br><i>Module: HttpProxyModule</i>
