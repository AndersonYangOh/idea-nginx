<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="proxy_read_timeout"> proxy_read_timeout </span></h2><p><b>syntax:</b> <i>proxy_read_timeout time;</i> </p><p><b>default:</b> <i>proxy_read_timeout 60s;</i> </p><p><b>context:</b> <i>http, server, location</i> </p><p>This directive sets the read timeout for the response of the proxied server. It determines how long nginx will wait to get the response to a request. The timeout is established not for entire response, but only between two operations of reading. </p><p>In contrast to <a href="#proxy_connect_timeout">proxy_connect_timeout</a>, this timeout will catch a server that puts you in it's connection pool but does not respond to you with anything beyond that. Be careful though not to set this too low, as your proxy server might take a longer time to respond to requests on purpose (e.g. when serving you a report page that takes some time to compute). You are able though to have a different setting per location, which enables you to have a higher proxy_read_timeout for the report page's location. </p><br><i>Module: HttpProxyModule</i>
