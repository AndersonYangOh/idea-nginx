</p><p>Directive assigns the correspondence of expansion and MIME-types of answers. To one MIME- type can correspond several expansions. By default it is used these correspondences:
</p><p></p>
<pre class="code"><span class="kw3">types</span> <span class="br0">&#123;</span>
  text/html    html;
  image/gif    gif;
  image/jpeg   jpg;
<span class="br0">&#125;</span></pre>
<p>The sufficiently complete table of mappings is included and is located in the file <code>conf/mime.types</code>.
</p><p>So that for that determined location's for all answers would reveal MIME- type <code>application/octet-stream</code>, it is possible to use the following:
</p><p></p>
<pre class="code"><span class="kw3">location</span> /download/ <span class="br0">&#123;</span>
  <span class="kw3">types</span>         <span class="br0">&#123;</span> <span class="br0">&#125;</span>
  <span class="kw3">default_type</span>  application/octet-stream;
<span class="br0">&#125;</span></pre>
