</p><p>This directive determines, to carry out reencoding for the response, obtained from the proxied
server or from FastCGI-server, if in the response-header a "Content-Type" header already is.
If reencoding is permitted, then as the initial encoding the encoding, indicated in the obtained answer, is used. 
</p><p>It is necessary to note that if the response was obtained in the subquery then, independent of directive override_charset,
is always carried out reencoding from encoding of the response into encoding of basic demand.
