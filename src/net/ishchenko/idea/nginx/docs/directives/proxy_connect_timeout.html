<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="proxy_connect_timeout"> proxy_connect_timeout </span></h2><p><b>syntax:</b> <i>proxy_connect_timeout time;</i> </p><p><b>default:</b> <i>proxy_connect_timeout 60s;</i> </p><p><b>context:</b> <i>http, server, location</i> </p><p>This directive assigns a timeout for the connection to the upstream server. It is necessary to keep in mind that this time out cannot be more than 75 seconds. </p><p>This is not the time until the server returns the pages, that is the <a href="#proxy_read_timeout"> proxy_read_timeout</a> statement. If your upstream server is up, but hanging (e.g. it does not have enough threads to process your request so it puts you in the pool of connections to deal with later), then this statement will not help as the connection to the server has been made. </p><br><i>Module: HttpProxyModule</i>
