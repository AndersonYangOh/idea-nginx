</p><p>This directive activate response buffering of the proxied server.
</p><p>If buffering is activated, then nginx assumes the answer of the proxied server as fast as possible, preserving it in the buffer, assigned by directive <code>proxy_buffer_size</code> and <code>proxy_buffers</code>.
</p><p>If the response can not all be placed in memory, then parts of it will be written to disk.
</p><p>If buffering is switched off, then the response is synchronously transferred to client immediately as it is received.
</p><p>nginx do not attempt to count entire answer of the proxied server, maximum size of data, which nginx can accept from the server it is assigned by directive <code>proxy_buffer_size</code>.
</p><p>For Comet applications based on long-polling it is important to set proxy_buffering to off, otherwise the asynchronous response is buffered and the Comet does not work.
