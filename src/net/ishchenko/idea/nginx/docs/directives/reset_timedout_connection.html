<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="reset_timedout_connection"> reset_timedout_connection </span></h2><p><b>syntax:</b> <i>reset_timedout_connection [on|off] </i> </p><p><b>default:</b> <i>reset_timedout_connection off</i> </p><p><b>context:</b> <i>http, server, location</i> </p><p>This directive enables or disables resetting the connection on timeout. When resetting the connection, before the socket is closed, the socket SO_LINGER option is set with a 0 timeout, which forces the RST packet to be sent to the client upon closing the socket, thus freeing all memory associated with it. This prevents the socket in the FIN_WAIT1 state, along with the buffers associated with it from lying around. </p><p>Note that sockets with keepalive connections, after the defined timeout, are closed in the usual way. </p><br><i>Module: HttpCoreModule</i>
